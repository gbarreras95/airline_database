GUI - java swing. use netbeans for IDE - payas said easiest way
error checking functionality - after they add in details, ask them if this is what they want.

PilotID can do either. we increment our own and return it. or make them enter it. maybe return options.

sql injections


'select * from plane where sdfjaks <' + "<<user input>>"

what if its ";drop table plane;" - can use libraries, might not even need that. sql injection sanitizer

i do book flight, list number seats, number repairs, number passangers. 

confirmed already happened. reserved is upcoming **

use indexes for sorting info. 

change startPostgreSQL.sh script to add path before initdb:
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/
	EXPORT PATH

has 2 or 3 indexes and explain performance boosts. there should be some way to improve performance.


DOCUMENTATION:
- assume only 1 flight number so we assume we use departure time fron flight table only.
- assume we list count first since they're sorted by count
